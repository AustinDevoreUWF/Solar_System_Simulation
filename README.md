# 2D Rocket Physics Simulator

This project is a custom 2D physics engine designed to simulate rocket motion under thrust and gravity. 
The goal is to model real-time flight dynamics: position, velocity, mass change due to fuel burn, and thrust vectoring.

The engine is written in C++ and is separated from the rendering/simulation layer for clarity and reusability.
